# Explaining-Fed-decisions-using-LSTM-and-SHAP
I use LSTM to simulate the decision of the Fed at which rate to set the Federal Fund Rate according to the FRED-MD dataset.
The process of deciding is then analyzed using the SHAP package to understand the decision taken by the Neural Network
and compare todays decision with those of the 70s and 80s where we also saw a rise in inflation.
This then makes it possible for me to agree or disagree with the statement of the fed to not react, 
to the rise in inflation by raising the federal fund rate (as should have done in the past) because the situation is a different one today.
